# Crystal Toolkit

Crystal Toolkit is an interactive web app from the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org)
that allows you to import, view, analyze and transform crystal structures and molecules.

## [Crystal Toolkit Web App](https://app.crystaltoolkit.org/)

You can visit the current Crystal Toolkit web app [here](https://app.crystaltoolkit.org/).

##### Analyze
Import any crystal structure or molecule from one of many common file formats,
and visualize and analyze using the power of pymatgen.

##### Transform
Many transformations can be applied, including guessing oxidation states,
creating surfaces, creating ordered approximations of disordered structures, and more.

##### Materials Project
Since 2011 The Materials Project has curated one of the world's largest open-access
computational databases of crystalline materials, and now numbers over 100,000 inorganic
crystal structures and millions of associated properties and all available to
use within Crystal Toolkit.
   

## Web App Framework

Crystal Toolkit is designed as a modular, object-orientated suite of UI components
built upon the Dash framework from Plotly. The main Crystal Toolkit web app is just 
one example of using these components.

**Warning: The Crystal Toolkit code not intended for public release yet.**
It is being developed in the open but the current master branch
may not work, and documentation may be incomplete and/or misleading. 
We're working hard to reach release status, please check back soon.
