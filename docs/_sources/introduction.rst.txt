============
Introduction
============

Crystal Toolkit is an interactive web app from the `Materials Project <https://materialsproject.org>`_
that allows you to import, view, analyze and transform crystal structures and molecules.


**Warning: The Crystal Toolkit code not intended for public release yet.**
It is being developed in the open but the current master branch
may not work, and documentation may be incomplete and/or misleading.
We're working hard to reach release status, please check back soon.

Web App
