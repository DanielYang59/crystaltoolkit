====================
Your First Component
====================

This page is intended for **developers of Crystal Toolkit** who want to add
a new ``MPComponent`` to support interactive viewing of an ``MSONable`` object,
such as crystal structures, phase diagrams, etc.

.. Important::
    Crystal Toolkit is built on top of `Dash by Plotly <https://dash.plot.ly>`_.
    Dash is a framework to build rich, interactive web apps purely from Python with
    no JavaScript knowledge required.
    If you're not familiar with the Dash framework, please read their documentation
    and try their example app first.
