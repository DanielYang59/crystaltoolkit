You can visit the current Crystal Toolkit web app [here](https://app.crystaltoolkit.org/).


## Web App Framework

Crystal Toolkit is designed as a modular, object-orientated suite of UI components
built upon the Dash framework from Plotly. The main Crystal Toolkit web app is just
one example of using these components.

**Warning: The Crystal Toolkit code not intended for public release yet.**
It is being developed in the open but the current master branch
